Immeadiately getting to work on this next project!
Even though at first blush it appears difficult (a drawing program? goodness gracious), after thinking for a hit it I think I have a good idea of how to accomplish this. The most difficult part will probably be making the resolution changeable. No idea for now on how to pull it off. Make div height and width = container width / resolution? I have a hunch that wouldn't work smoothly...
Note to self: don't try to make it work on mobile
